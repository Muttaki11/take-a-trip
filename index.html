        <p class="description">I don’t believe there is a “right” way to travel – everyone should be <br> free to roam around the world in the way they wish.</p>
        <ul class="description">
          <li>Don’t forget that all the cities you visit around the world are not your personal theme <br> park, and have other interests than satisfy your needs or preferences.</li>
          <li>Get to know the people, listen to them, don’t judge, be respectful, and leave <br> whatever attitude you have at home.</li>
          <li>Do you remember when you were a kid and would get totally absorbed in something? <br> Reclaim that curiosity, that joy, and that attitude towards life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">However, the most memorable experiences usually happen when you stumble upon places that <br> you did not expect – or even planned – to see. And a benefit of organizing everything before <br> traveling lays also in the possibility to make time for totally spontaneous activities. By turning <br> left instead of right, you’ll discover places you didn’t even know existed.</p>
